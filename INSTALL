OVERVIEW

The machine you untarred this distribution onto can become your
administrative workstation for Cauliflower Vest.  From here you can setup
configuration, push config and code to your App Engine instance, and build
.DMGs to install on your clients or build into your system image.


PREREQUISITES

App Engine SDK
--------------
Portions of the App Engine SDK are supplied in zips for importing where
necessary.

./src/tests/gae_server.zip supplies the App Engine SDK so that all
unit tests may run without requiring the SDK.

./src/cauliflowervest/client/gae_client.zip supplies a small portion of the
App Engine SDK so that client functions may run without needing the full SDK
on each client.

However, you will need the full App Engine SDK so that you can upload the
Cauliflower Vest service to your App Engine instance.

For information on downloading and installing the SDK, see:
  http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

Python
------
Other Python packages are also required, but our dependency on them should be
automatically resolved by setuptools.

TESTING

Before installation, one should run the unit tests to make sure
that your Python is working correctly.

  make test

For more information about testing, refer to our wiki URL.


INSTALLATION

Installation tasks can be grouped into three steps:

  * Configuration for your site
  * Pushing the server code to your App Engine instance
  * Rolling a .dmg to install on your clients

For information on configuration, pushing your server code, and rolling
dmgs, refer our wiki URL.
